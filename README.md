# Simple-Tesseract-OCR-Example
This simple snippet of code performs an OCR to detect text from an image. It uses Google Tesseract to perform the OCR. You will need to install Google Tesseract on your PC as well as pytesseract and pillow libraries for Python. 

1. Tesseract OCR Example.ipynb
<br>Contains a simple code to perform OCR (text recognition in images) for a single image. For multiple images, put the code inside a loop and loop over a set of images. Incase of videos, refer my repository for Barcode Detection. It has a code file for working with videos. Replace the barcode detection code in the loop with the OCR code. That file also has a commented line to save a video as frames, after performing any desired actions on it. The repository also contains a code file that assembles frames to a video.
